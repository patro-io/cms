## Important Notes

1. **This is a PACKAGE DEVELOPMENT repo** - Not an application!
2. **Primary focus**: Developing and maintaining `@patro-io/cms` npm package
3. **No root src/**: The old application code has been moved to the package
4. **Testing applications**: Use `my-patro-app/` for testing the published package
5. **When developing**:
   - Modify `packages/core/` for core functionality
   - Test changes by republishing and installing in `my-patro-app/`
   - Or use `npm link` for local testing

## Current Focus
Moving core functionality to npm package for reusability across projects.
